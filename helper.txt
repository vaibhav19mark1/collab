Yes I would like to use your recommendations for now
1. Server Components with auth() for SSR pages
2. Protected Route Component for client-side protection
3. API Route Protection for backend endpoints
4. Axios Interceptors for API call management

Guide me through this process and also tell me the path and file name where I should make the files
